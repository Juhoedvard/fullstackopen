# Bloglist


## Description:

This is project is started from Helsinkin University cource fullstackopen https://fullstackopen.com/#course-contents which I continued to bit further.
This project is my first touch to web development so it is not so advanced. Project is simple bloglist where you can add your own blogs and manage them.
I used create-react-app to setup the project and following frameworks: 

  Client:

  -[axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
  -[react](https://react.dev/) react-redux, react-router-dom
  -[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

  Server: 
  -[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database 
  -[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for managing database
  -[Jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) for authentication
  -[cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) for middleware
  -[express](https://expressjs.com/) for manage serverside
  -[jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
